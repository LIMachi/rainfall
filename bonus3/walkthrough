this one was way too simple to be the last bonus XD
(see tests and source)
simply put: we need to match an unknown string (our password) with the first arg of bonus3,
and this first arg is also used to get the length of the password that will be used for the match
inputting a null string results in comparing the null string with a string of length 0
(which is valid)

./bonus3 ""
cat /home/user/end/.pass
