this level is almost identical to level3, the only real changes are the use of printf in a sub-function and the check against 0x1025544
using the same steps as level3, we found the correct position of our string (arg 12 of printf) and the address of m (0x8049810),
and because 0x1025544 is way to big a size for our input (which is limited to 0x200), we will use one of the features of printf:
%<width><format> you can set a width for a format so that printf will try to pad with spaces/zeroes (based on format or other options) so that the output is of the requested size
the final payload is: <address>%16930112c%12n\n, we use %c as the padder, as the first arg of printf is printable (0x200), 16930112 is 0x1025544 - 4

(wait that all the characters have been printed, can take a while)
