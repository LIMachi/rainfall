same steps as before (we scp the exec to run dogbolt on it)
once again we have a dubious usage of gets, so trying a stack smash seem the likely solution
trying the same technic as before has one caveat though:
this time the program checks if we have manipulated the stack where ebp was stored
(mov    -0xc(%ebp),%eax, and    $0xb0000000,%eax, cmp    $0xb0000000,%eax)
(the check seem to only look at some bits on the left of the address: 10110000000000000000000000000000)
so the solution would be to generate a smash that points in a valid space
