//after the full analysis, our guess is that this is a function that tries to accept any string as input and check if a stack smashing occurred (returning the input string or exiting with code 1 if a smash was detected)
char *p() {
    //push %ebp: store return address on the stack (convention of function start)
    //mov %esp,%ebp: use ebp to hold the previous state of the stack (for easy cleanup)
    void* check = (void*)&check; //note: all the decompilers seem to see this var as being used uninitialized, but my theory is that it represents a position in the stack
    char buff[76]; //sub    $0x68,%esp reserve 0x68 (104) bytes from the stack to store the local variables of the function, dogbolt seem to estimate that only 76 of those bytes are for this array (see how -0x4c(%ebp),%eax is used to generate the pointer passed to gets, 0x4c is 76)

    fflush(stdout); //update stdout (not sure why)
    gets(buff); //first line of man for gets: "Never use this function.", now we know why :P
    if ((((size_t)check) & 0xb00000000) == 0xb0000000) { //verify that check was not tempered with and still points to the stack (not toward the code section)

        exit(1);
    }
    puts(buff); //write the input to stdout, appending a newline at the end
