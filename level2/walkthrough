(more explanations in Ressources)

2 new things:
we don't have an obvious access to system/execve or other way to get a terminal or the password itself
so we will have to make code that will be executed by level2 (see payload_asm.asm)
also, 'p' checks if we smashed it's stack by applying the mask 0xb00000000 to a section of the stack where the smash could happen
meaning we can't smash the stack to point to the stack itself where our payload is (inside buff)
but we can point to the heap (buff is copied to the heap by strdup at the end of p)
and malloc is deterministic, so our payload will always be at 0x804a008 and this passes the check

scp -P 4242 payload level2@192.168.56.102:/tmp/payload2

cat /tmp/payload2 - | ./level2
